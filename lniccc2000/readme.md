# STNICCC2000 port to Atari Lynx II

This is another port, this time with all 1800 frames running closely to 20FPS.

I am standing on other shoulders.

First of all Leonard^Oxygene who did the orignial demo and the data set.

Then Harry Dogdson who made the first Lynx encryption available to the homebrew scenen.

Carl Forhan, who likely achieved it that Atari accecpt the homebrew scene.

W/o laoo's Felix Lynx emulator, I would have never did reach so far in so short time.

I have also used/improved Karri's ABC player to have some sort of "music" ;-)

And last but not least Lars Baumstark who was the driving force in the beginning to get me into Lynx and Jaguar hacking.

Sage/Karri and others who helped to improve sprpck and lyxass.

So in short, if someone coding for the Lynx claims he/she did all on his/her own, well chapeau. :( But why, only not to pay credit? Well, then.
